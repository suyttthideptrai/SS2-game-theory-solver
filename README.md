The page will reload when you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the default setup, you can eject it. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies into your project so you have full control over them.
